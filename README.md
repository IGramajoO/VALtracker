## Problem
Many online trackers are hard to navigate because there is too much information on the screen. Online trackers are only accessable through the web browser, making it difficult to share stats with others when users are away from their computers.

## Our Solution
VALtracker allows users to view their game stats with an easy-to-read and easy-to-use UI. User's stats update after every game and provide an overview of how each game went compared to previous matches. A search feature is provided for users to look up other player's stats and allow for comparisions. An app allows for users to share their successes and stats with others on the go.
